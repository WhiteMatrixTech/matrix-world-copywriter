          question: 'What is Matrix World?',
          answer: `
          Matrix World is an open world that enables users to build 3D immersive applications on top of several blockchains. In Matrix World, users can take advantage of traditional 3D open-world features such as building 3D architectures, hosting virtual meetings, exhibiting NFTs, and more advanced functionality such as creating their own 3D decentralized applications (Dapps) using Matrix's built-in computation resources.`,
        },
        {
          question: 'When will Matrix World release?',
          answer: `Matrix World is currently in the pre-alpha version. We are now constructing public toolsï¼Œservices, and buildings such as universities and headquarters for famous companies. This will make our metaverse world energetic and provide fully functional support for the community. We set up joint laboratories with different partners and help them get connected to the decentralized world.

          We plan to open up alpha testing of Matrix World to the community in
          6 months, with more features and creator-friendly metaverse
          environment betas coming in 2023.

          In 2022 Q2, we will open the alpha version of Matrix World, with a
          fundamental fast build toolbox and low code development platform to
          help the users build the metaverse world. We will also present
          public service buildings for practical use, such as education,
          tourism, and social connections. The beta version is coming in 2023,
          and we will do the official opening in early 2024.`,

          question:
            'Which platform should I choose to participate in Matrix World?',
          answer: `Currently, we don't support mobile devices. Users can run Matrix World
          from a PC or Mac running Chrome or Firefox. While it may be
          technically possible that other browsers might work, to ensure optimal
          performance, we highly recommend Firebox or Chrome.`,
        },
        {
          question:
            'Why should I participate in Matrix World?/What are some highlights in Matrix World?',
          answer: `Matrix World is the first open virtual world project simultaneously
          running on different blockchain networks. The system now supports
          Ethereum and Flow, and we plan to include more blockchain networks
          as its persistent and consensus layer.

          The Matrix team has extensive experience with blockchain games,
            middleware, and the metaverse. Cell Evolution won an award worth
            millions successfully helped us establish closer connections with
            the world's first developer ecosystems of the blockchain games. We
            collaborate with ChainIDE, a cloud-based integrated development
            environment that provides online services in more than 165
            countries. The Metaverse Bootcamp that we co-hosted incubated and
            escorted over 30 blockchain games and metaverse projects.

            We feel proud of the global developer ecosystem and partnership we
            have developed. Our official partnership with the Flow team makes
            Matrix World the first metaverse project in the Flow ecosystem.
            Furthermore, the Flow team plan to build a Flow headquarter in
            Matrix World. Flow blockchain projects like CryptoKitties and NBA
            Topshots will collaborate with Matrix World gradually.`,

      questionList: [
        {
          question: 'What is Matrix Land?',
          answer: `Matrix Land is the smallest territorial unit in Matrix World with
          finite computation and storage resources. A Land is also represented
          on several blockchains as a tradable NFT token. For instance, it will
          be an ERC721 token on Ethereum, whereas on Flow will be an on-chain
          Flow resource.`,
        },
        {
          question: 'How large is a tile of Matrix Land?',
          answer: `Land parcels are 30m x 30m, or 99ft x 99ft, and there will be a height
          limitation which we are still deciding. However, if you are our
          partners or community members, you can apply Super Height for special
          usage.`,
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I merge or split Matrix Land?',
          answer: `If owners buy more than one land parcel, they can split it and sell
          it in parts.

          When a group of Lands shares the same owner, the owner can choose to
            merge the Lands into a Space for larger construction and more
            complicated application development. The computation resources and
            storage of the Lands will get merged too.`,
        },
        {
          question: 'What can Land owners do?',
          answer: `The Matrix Lands are tradable and transferable via blockchain
          networks, and their owners retain complete control over the creations
          on their Lands in Matrix World. Users can take advantage of
          traditional 3D open-world features such as building 3D architectures,
          hosting virtual meetings, exhibiting NFTs, and more advanced
          functionality such as creating their own 3D decentralized Applications
          (DApps) using Matrix's built-in computation resources. These DApps
          include 3D games and 3D marketplace, among others.`,
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I resell my Land in the pre-alpha phase?',
          answer: `Yes. On both blockchain networks, Ethereum and Flow, Matrix lands are
          tradable and transferable even during the pre-alpha phase.`,

          question: 'Which blockchain ecosystems will Matrix support?',
          answer: `One significant feature of Matrix World is multichain connectivity.
            Matrix World system will maintain identities across various
            blockchains. At the moment, we plan to support Ethereum and Flow, but
            we propose to integrate additional EVM-based and layer-2 blockchains
            in the near future. Creators can also connect Matrix Objects to
            external smart contracts running on multiple blockchain networks. For
            instance, a creator can create a 3D Uniswap ATM by crafting its
            appearance and defining the function to invoke Uniswap's swap function
            in Ethereum. Similarly, a creator can also construct a 3D video
            gallery featuring Flow's NBA Topshot moments.`,
        },
        {
          question: 'What is Space Virtual Machine?',
          answer: `Everything inside Matrix World is programmable. All the objects in a
            Land are managed by a canonical virtual machine called Space Virtual
            Machine (SVM), which has its own set of characteristics, 3D
            appearance, and lifecycle. Meanwhile, users can define custom
            attributes and implement custom methods to modify these Matrix
            Objects' behavior. A complex 3D application is formed by a collection
            of several programmed/scripted Matrix Objects that can interact with
            each other. Authorized creators can simply program the actions of
            Objects using the Matrix Object and Scene Editor.`,
        },
        {
          question: 'What is Matrix Object?',
          answer: `Matrix Object is the collective name of all the 3D programmable
            objects in the Matrix World. These objects' appearance, actions, and
            lifecycles are managed by the Space Virtual Machine (SVM). Matrix
            object is hierarchical, which means it can have nested child Objects
            attached to it.`,
        },
        {
          question: 'How will Matrix support Dapps?',
          answer: `Matrix World is a 3D Dapp platform. Matrix network consists of a
            number of Space Virtual Machine (SVM), each of which is responsible
            for running a Scene on a specific Land that offers various
            functionalities. Creators can make a 3D application solely on one SVM
            and create cross-SVM or multiscene applications. Matrix World will
            provide creators with development and automation tools to facilitate
            scene and Dapp development. We hope that in the future, thousands of
            3D applications will operate concurrently in Matrix World.`,
