          question: 'When will Matrix World release?',
          answer: `Matrix World is currently in the pre-alpha version. We are now constructing public tools，services, and buildings such as universities and headquarters for famous companies. This will make our metaverse world energetic and provide fully functional support for the community. We set up joint laboratories with different partners and help them get connected to the decentralized world.

          We plan to open up alpha testing of Matrix World to the community in 6 months, with more features and creator-friendly metaverse environment betas coming in 2023.

          In 2022 Q2, we will open the alpha version of Matrix World, with a fundamental fast build toolbox and low code development platform to help the users build the metaverse world. We will also present public service buildings for practical use, such as education, tourism, and social connections. The beta version is coming in 2023, and we will do the official opening in early 2024.`,

          answer: `1.Matrix World is the first open virtual world project simultaneously running on different blockchain networks. The system now supports Ethereum and Flow, and we plan to include more blockchain networks as its persistent and consensus layer.

          2.The Matrix team has extensive experience with blockchain games, middleware, and the metaverse. Cell Evolution won an award worth millions successfully helped us establish closer connections with the world's first developer ecosystems of the blockchain games. We collaborate with ChainIDE, a cloud-based integrated development environment that provides online services in more than 165 countries. The Metaverse Bootcamp that we co-hosted incubated and escorted over 30 blockchain games and metaverse projects.

          3.We feel proud of the global developer ecosystem and partnership we have developed. Our official partnership with the Flow team makes Matrix World the first metaverse project in the Flow ecosystem. Furthermore, the Flow team plan to build a Flow headquarter in Matrix World. Flow blockchain projects like CryptoKitties and NBA Topshots will collaborate with Matrix World gradually.`,

          question: 'Can I merge or split Matrix Land?',
          answer: `If owners buy more than one land parcel, they can split it and sell it in parts.

          When a group of Lands shares the same owner, the owner can choose to merge the Lands into a Space for larger construction and more complicated application development. The computational resources and storage of the Lands will get merged too.`,

          answer: `One significant feature of Matrix World is multichain connectivity. Matrix World system will maintain identities across various blockchains. At the moment, we plan to support Ethereum and Flow, but
we propose to integrate additional EVM-based and layer-2 blockchains in the near future. Creators can also connect Matrix Objects to
external smart contracts running on multiple blockchain networks. For instance, a creator can create a 3D Uniswap ATM by crafting its
appearance and defining the function to invoke Uniswap's swap function in Ethereum. Similarly, a creator can also construct a 3D video
gallery featuring Flow's NBA Topshot moments.`,
        },
        {
          question: 'What is Space Virtual Machine?',
          answer: `Everything inside Matrix World is programmable. All the objects in a Land are managed by a canonical virtual machine called Space Virtual Machine (SVM), which has its own set of characteristics, 3D appearance, and lifecycle. Meanwhile, users can define custom attributes and implement custom methods to modify these Matrix Objects' behavior. A complex 3D application is formed by a collection of several programmed/scripted Matrix Objects that can interact with each other. Authorized creators can simply program the actions of Objects using the Matrix Object and Scene Editor.`,
        },
        {
          question: 'What is Matrix Object?',
          answer: `Matrix Object is the collective name of all the 3D programmable objects in the Matrix World. These objects' appearance, actions, and lifecycles are managed by the Space Virtual Machine (SVM). Matrix object is hierarchical, which means it can have nested child Objects attached to it.`,
        },
        {
          question: 'How will Matrix support DApps?',
          answer: `Matrix World is a 3D DApp platform. Matrix network consists of a number of Space Virtual Machine (SVM), each of which is responsible for running a Scene on a specific Land that offers various functionalities. Creators can make a 3D application solely on one SVM and create cross-SVM or multiscene applications. Matrix World will provide creators with development and automation tools to facilitate scene and DApp development. We hope that in the future, thousands of 3D applications will operate concurrently in Matrix World.`,
